**Tweet 1 (Hook)**

I just published a FREE complete guide to learning AI programming from absolute zero.

No coding experience needed.

From Python basics → Machine Learning → Deep Learning → Building LLM apps.

A thread on what you'll learn (and the best free resources) 🧵👇

Step 1: Learn Python

Python is the #1 language for AI. Period.

Start here (all free):
• Python Official Tutorial
• Automate the Boring Stuff (free book)
• freeCodeCamp 4-hour Python course

Focus on: variables, loops, functions, lists, dictionaries.

Step 2: Data Science Foundations

Before AI, you need to speak "data."

Learn these 3 libraries:
• NumPy — math & arrays
• Pandas — data manipulation
• Matplotlib — visualization

Free resource: Kaggle's Pandas micro-course

Step 3: Machine Learning with Scikit-learn

This is where it gets exciting.

Key concepts:
• Supervised vs unsupervised learning
• Train/test split
• Model evaluation

Start with: Linear Regression, Random Forest, K-Means

Free: Google ML Crash Course

Here's a complete ML example in ~10 lines of Python:

```python
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
from sklearn.datasets import load_iris
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

X, y = load_iris(return_X_y=True)
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y)
model = RandomForestClassifier()
model.fit(X_train, y_train)
print(f"Accuracy: {model.score(X_test, y_test):.0%}")
```

That's it. You just trained an AI model.

Step 4: Deep Learning with PyTorch

Neural networks power everything from image recognition to ChatGPT.

Learn:
• How neural networks work
• CNNs (images)
• Transformers (language)

Best free courses:
• Fast.ai
• 3Blue1Brown Neural Networks series
• Andrej Karpathy's YouTube

Step 5: LLM Application Development

This is the hottest skill in tech right now.

Learn to:
• Use OpenAI / Anthropic APIs
• Master Prompt Engineering
• Build RAG applications
• Use LangChain & LlamaIndex

You can build real products with just API calls.

Prompt Engineering is underrated.

The difference between a bad and great prompt:

Bad: "Tell me about dogs"

Good: "You are a veterinary expert. List the top 5 health issues for golden retrievers with symptoms and prevention. Use a numbered list."

Same AI. Completely different results.

RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) is a game-changer.

It lets you build AI that answers questions from YOUR data:

Your docs → split into chunks → store as vectors → user asks question → find relevant chunks → send to LLM → accurate answer

No fine-tuning needed.

---

Key techniques to master:
• Role prompting — "You are an expert in..."
• Few-shot — give examples of desired output
• Chain of thought — "Think step by step"
• Output formatting — "Respond in JSON/table"

These work with any LLM (GPT, Claude, Llama, etc.)

---

Tools you should know:

• LangChain — LLM app framework
• LlamaIndex — data framework for RAG
• Hugging Face — model hub
• Streamlit — build web UIs fast
• ChromaDB / FAISS — vector databases

All free and open source.

Suggested learning timeline:

Month 1-2: Python basics
Month 3: Data science (NumPy, Pandas)
Month 4-5: Machine learning (Scikit-learn)
Month 6-7: Deep learning (PyTorch)
Month 8+: LLM apps & specialization

Adjust to your pace. Consistency > speed.

Project ideas to build your portfolio:

1. Housing price predictor (ML)
2. Image classifier (Deep Learning)
3. AI chatbot (LLM API)
4. Document Q&A system (RAG)
5. AI writing assistant

Each one teaches you different skills.

Best free courses (ranked):

1. Fast.ai — practical deep learning
2. Andrew Ng's ML Specialization — fundamentals
3. CS50 AI (Harvard) — broad intro
4. Hugging Face NLP Course — transformers
5. Google ML Crash Course — quick start

All completely free.

The #1 tip for learning AI:

BUILD THINGS.

Reading tutorials ≠ learning.

Pick a project you care about and build it. Get stuck. Debug. Google. Ask ChatGPT. Read docs. Repeat.

That's how you actually learn.

---

**Tweet 16 (CTA)**

I wrote a complete guide covering all of this with:
• Code examples for every section
• Curated free resources
• Hands-on project walkthroughs
• A clear learning roadmap

It's 100% free on GitHub:
